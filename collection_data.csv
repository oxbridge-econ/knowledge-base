Plus, Ukraine talks, the New York mayoral race and Wes Anderson.View in browser|nytimes.comMarch 24, 2025By German LopezGood morning. We‚Äôre covering immigrants‚Äô constitutional rights ‚Äî as well as Ukraine talks, the New York mayoral race and Wes Anderson.At a demonstration in New York City. ¬†David Dee Delgado/ReutersImmigrant silenceThe Trump administration has tried in recent weeks to deport several immigrants who spoke out against Israel. First, it arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a green-card holder who‚Äôd joined pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University. Officials also arrested a Georgetown University researcher with an academic visa. They deported a nephrologist at Brown University, even though she had a valid visa. Another student activist at Columbia fled to Canada after immigration officials came to her home.President Trump has said that more arrests will come ‚Äî a test of the government‚Äôs ability to deport people with views that he disagrees with.How is this legal? The First Amendment, after all, protects freedom of speech in nearly absolute terms. It allows people to espouse even the most unsavory views, including support for genocide, and face no criminal penalty as a result.But Trump is taking advantage of a genuinely unsettled aspect of the law: Does the Constitution protect noncitizens‚Äô freedom of speech? Today‚Äôs newsletter will look at the arguments.Trump‚Äôs caseThe Supreme Court has said that the First Amendment applies to noncitizens in the United States when it comes to criminal and civil penalties. But those protections don‚Äôt necessarily apply to deportations, the court has found. The federal government has nearly absolute power over immigration, including its ability to deport noncitizens; it gets to decide who comes and then stays in this country, potentially at the expense of constitutional rights.In 1952, for example, the Supreme Court ruled that the government could deport immigrants for Communist Party membership without violating the First Amendment. (I experienced this firsthand: A government official asked me if I was a communist during my interview to become a U.S. citizen in the 2000s.)More specifically, administration officials cite a 1952 statute that lets the government deport immigrants, even green-card holders, for views that hamper U.S. foreign policy. The administration says that Khalil and others supported Hamas and Hezbollah, designated terrorist groups. That supposed support seems to be limited to the immigrants‚Äô advocacy ‚Äî social media posts, fliers, protests, attendance at a Hezbollah leader‚Äôs funeral. The government has not accused them of sending money or other assistance to those groups. It says that speech is enough to justify deportation.Last week, the administration leveled new accusations against Khalil. It said that he failed to disclose his membership in pro-Palestinian groups or his work for the British government when he applied for a green card. The hastily added accusations appear to be an attempt to sidestep free speech concerns about his case, my colleague Jonah Bromwich wrote.Immigrants do have due process rights, and Khalil‚Äôs case is currently going through the courts. But the administration has tried to bypass even those protections in other cases. It cited the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants without any kind of hearing in court. It claimed, but did not prove, that these migrants were members of criminal gangs supported by the Venezuelan government.The administration‚Äôs efforts to punish speech and bypass due process would be blatantly unconstitutional for a U.S. citizen. But for immigrants, the legality of the government‚Äôs actions is less certain.The oppositionThis approach leaves immigrants with no practical free speech rights, Nadine Strossen, former president of the A.C.L.U., told me. The First Amendment allows us to speak freely without fear of legal retribution. But if an immigrant‚Äôs political advocacy gets him deported, he does have to worry about retribution ‚Äî and may choose not to speak at all.While conservatives may feel empowered now, their approach could backfire in the future. Suppose that conservative immigrants ‚Äî say, Trump-supporting Venezuelans, known as MAGAzuelans ‚Äî attend a Make America Great Again rally. A Democratic administration could claim that participants of the rally supported an enemy of the United States by, for example, opposing aid to Ukraine. That administration could then try to deport the immigrants for their speech.This is the slippery slope of exceptions to free speech and other constitutional rights: What counts as a violent act? What is a terrorist group? Who is an enemy of the United States? What does it mean to support them? A president can twist the answers to these questions to fit any agenda and go after people with opposing views, bypassing fundamental rights.What‚Äôs nextThe Supreme Court has not directly addressed the issue of immigrants‚Äô free speech rights since the Red Scare of the 1940s and ‚Äô50s. Lower courts have, but they have been divided. As the Trump administration tests the law, the Supreme Court will likely have to chime in once again.In the meantime, immigrants have reason to worry. Already, college officials have warned immigrant students that nobody can protect them. In that sense, the Trump administration‚Äôs approach is already working: It has likely persuaded immigrants to stay quiet about causes that the president disagrees with.THE LATEST NEWSWar in UkraineRussian and U.S. officials are meeting in Saudi Arabia to discuss details of a limited cease-fire in Ukraine.

Plus, the Democratic Party, Elon Musk and a scammer‚Äôs manual.View in browser|nytimes.comMarch 23, 2025Good morning. Today you‚Äôll hear from our theater reporter, Michael Paulson, about the rising cost of hot Broadway tickets. We‚Äôre also covering the Democratic Party, Elon Musk and a scammer‚Äôs manual.At the Ethel Barrymore Theater in New York. ¬†Amir Hamja for The New York TimesPut money in thy purseBy Michael PaulsonI am The Times‚Äôs theater reporter.There‚Äôs a starry production of ‚ÄúOthello‚Äù opening on Broadway tonight. And if you‚Äôre among the many people who really, really want to see Denzel Washington as a jealous general, opposite Jake Gyllenhaal as a scheming Iago, it‚Äôs going to cost you: Most of the center orchestra seats, as well as a few rows in the mezzanine, are being sold for $921 apiece.The high prices for this Shakespeare classic are setting records. During its second week of previews, ‚ÄúOthello‚Äù grossed more at the box office than any other nonmusical play had ever grossed on Broadway.Tickets for the hottest Broadway shows are now out of reach for many. And the same is true for other sought-after live events, such as pop concerts (which now cost hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars per ticket) and big sports games. (A few weeks before the Super Bowl, the cheapest available tickets were reselling for more than the average monthly mortgage payment.)In today‚Äôs newsletter, I‚Äôll explain how Broadway seats became so eye-poppingly pricey.Trying to break evenProducing Broadway shows has become more expensive since the pandemic, and a vast majority of them lose money. So producers have been staging more short runs of plays with stars in lead roles ‚Äî the stars attract ticket buyers, and the short runs allow those stars to more quickly return to filmmaking, which pays better than Broadway. Limited runs also seem to incentivize potential ticket buyers, because people find the now-or-never aspect motivating.There is, of course, a tension between profitability and accessibility. These prices are preventing some potential theatergoers from seeing high-profile productions of important work.Investors who spend money to bring shows to Broadway embrace high ticket prices because they want at least a shot at recouping their expenses. But many theater lovers, as they reminded me in a rollicking comments thread on the story I wrote about this subject last week, find these prices upsetting, because they want to see the shows they want to see at price points they consider reasonable.Atop the Booth Theater in New York.¬†Sara Krulwich/The New York Times‚ÄúOthello,‚Äù with an average ticket price last week of $338.83, is the most expensive show on Broadway right now, but it‚Äôs not the only costly ticket. A stage adaptation of ‚ÄúGood Night, and Good Luck‚Äù starring George Clooney had an average ticket price of $303.75 last week, and a revival of ‚ÄúGlengarry Glen Ross‚Äù featuring Bill Burr, Kieran Culkin and Bob Odenkirk had an average price of $207.40.It‚Äôs important to be aware that most shows cost far less. The overall average ticket price on Broadway last week was $134.96. There were nine shows selling seats for under $50, including Tony-winning productions of ‚ÄúChicago‚Äù and ‚ÄúHadestown‚Äù and ‚ÄúHarry Potter and the Cursed Child.‚ÄùBargain hunters can often get even better deals by purchasing discounted tickets at a TKTS booth, entering an online lottery, lining up for rush tickets, finding a promo code or just sitting in seats that aren‚Äôt quite as close to the stage.Supply and demandSome people don‚Äôt like it when I say this, but ticket prices are set to reflect market demand. Tickets cost more for shows that have high demand and limited supply (there are 1,042 seats in the theater where ‚ÄúOthello‚Äù is playing); prices are higher for performances at the most desirable times and for seats in the most desirable locations. And if you wait until the last minute to look for tickets to a buzzy show, you‚Äôre probably going to pay more.Broadway producers hire consultants to advise them on pricing strategy, and some engage in dynamic pricing, adjusting prices to reflect shifting demand in real time. Producers often remind me that if they underprice tickets, those tickets will get scooped up by speculators who then seek to make a profit on the resale market, effectively redirecting a show‚Äôs financial upside away from artists and investors and toward de facto scalpers.What happens next? Reviews for ‚ÄúOthello‚Äù should start rolling out in the wee hours of Monday morning. (The show gave critics free tickets under the condition that reviews be published after midnight, so the company can enjoy its opening night party without worrying about notices.) If the reviews are great, prices could rise; if they are terrible, they could fall ‚Äî although the show is already pretty well sold, so there‚Äôs not a ton of remaining inventory. Meantime, expect prices for the most in-demand shows, on Broadway and beyond, to remain high as long as there are people willing to pay those prices.THE LATEST NEWSImmigrationVenezuela said it would resume accepting U.S. deportation flights.

Five books later, she returns to this dystopian world with a propulsive new prequel, ‚ÄúSunrise on the Reaping,‚Äù which unspools the story of Katniss‚Äôs louche, loyal mentor, Haymitch Abernathy. Readers of the original ‚ÄúHunger Games‚Äù trilogy will remember that a teenage Haymitch won the 50th Hunger Games and, when he returned home, found a government-inflicted tragedy that would haunt him for the rest of his life. In this new installment, Collins fills in the details ‚Äî and, in doing so, explores with devastating precision how disinformation and authoritarianism work. There is so much that is out of Haymitch‚Äôs control: With the odds stacked against him 47-1, he certainly doesn‚Äôt expect to make it out of the Games alive. But he and the vibrant cast of new and familiar characters find ways to resist the government‚Äôs script, clinging to a piece of advice from Haymitch‚Äôs father: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let them paint their posters with your blood.‚ÄùMore on the bookRead the full review here.Need a refresher on the world of ‚ÄúThe Hunger Games‚Äù? Here‚Äôs a handy guide.THE INTERVIEWPhilip Montgomery for The New York TimesBy David MarcheseThis week‚Äôs subject for The Interview is the clinical psychologist Dr. Lindsay Gibson, author of the best-selling book ‚ÄúAdult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents.‚ÄùWhat might your book‚Äôs ongoing popularity say about the culture now?I think the book‚Äôs ongoing popularity has been due to the fact that it said something about the cultural stereotype that we‚Äôve had about parents for eons: that all parents love their children; all parents only want the best for their children. I think people‚Äôs actual experience is that these stereotypes don‚Äôt match up with their emotional experience.One of the problems with contemporary life is how we label other people in ways that are reductive. Is there any part of you that thinks it‚Äôs not a good thing for the people who have read your book to be thinking about a parent, ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre emotionally immature, and that is what defines you now?‚ÄùAbsolutely, I think it‚Äôs a danger. That is the problem with the categorizing part of our mind. Once we call something something, we think we know all about it. I‚Äôve tried to moderate that by helping people see more of the big picture about why these people became emotionally immature, what they‚Äôre trying to do with that kind of behavior and what you can do about it.Do children owe parents anything?I look at that question differently. I look at it as, do any of us owe anybody else anything?What‚Äôs the answer?Yes, I think we do. If I‚Äôm walking down the street and somebody trips and falls, I‚Äôm going to help them get up. I wouldn‚Äôt want to live in a world where that wasn‚Äôt there, but what has happened is that there has been such an assumption that because you‚Äôre my child, you owe me something. That‚Äôs where you get to a point where there should be a boundary. Know what it‚Äôs going to cost you to respond. Think about yourself too, and then make your best decision.Read more of the interview here.THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINEPhoto illustration by Bobby Doherty.

Being new at something isn‚Äôt always pleasant. But rewards await.View in browser|nytimes.comMarch 22, 2025By Melissa KirschGood morning. Being new at something isn‚Äôt always pleasant, but beyond the discomfort, rewards await.Mar√≠a Jes√∫s ContrerasSpring awakeningOne afternoon last week, I convinced a friend to accompany me to a restaurant in Brooklyn to learn how to play Hong Kong-style mahjong. I‚Äôd always been intrigued by mahjong‚Äôs colorful bakelite tiles, the satisfying clacking sound they make as they‚Äôre shuffled. My mother plays the American version twice a week with the same groups of friends, a clubby ritual that makes me a little jealous: Why don‚Äôt I have a regular game of something going?We were a group of 15 or so students, all new to the game. To begin, we played a dummy round with all the tiles turned over so that everyone could see their values and the teacher could walk us through each step of gameplay: Here‚Äôs how you set up the table, building a wall of tiles. Roll the dice to see which player gets to break the wall. These are the suit tiles, these are the honor tiles, the dragons, the winds.Mahjong‚Äôs not a cinch to learn. Our teacher was excellent, repeating each step of the rules several times, asking us to repeat them back to him. There were whiffs of card games I knew, but I found the intricacies confusing: Wait, you need three identical tiles to form a pung? How did that guy just win the game when I was still working out how the flower tiles operate?And then: Why am I learning to play this game when I already know many other games and I do not ever play them? This was the thought that snagged me, that made me want to politely claim an emergency and walk out mid-lesson: Why am I doing this? Ostensibly, I‚Äôm a curious person, one who‚Äôs drawn to new experiences, who wants to expand her horizons, to multiply opportunities for fun. Mahjong offers all of these things! But learning a new game is something I haven‚Äôt done in ages. It‚Äôs something kids (and their parents) do readily, but eventually, most of us stop. The machinery for learning new things becomes creaky. It‚Äôs not easy or comfortable to get that old mainframe up and running again. So many things in life are not easy or comfortable already! Why opt in to another one? And do I even have room in my brain, on my calendar, for another thing that I do?The friend I‚Äôd brought with me to mahjong surprised me a few days later, when I had assumed we‚Äôd both decided that our lesson was diverting enough, but neither of us had the energy or appetite or brain plasticity to ever play again. ‚ÄúI got us a mahjong set,‚Äù she announced. ‚ÄúNow we just need two other people and we can play.‚Äù I thought back to our lesson, how I‚Äôd wanted to leave because I wasn‚Äôt mastering mahjong fast enough. Being bad at something feels bad. Being new is often unpleasant and embarrassing. Of course we default to doing things we‚Äôre good at. We like to be confident and comfortable and look cool.But here was an invitation to community. An invitation to be bad at something with other people, with the goal of getting to the other side: a new hobby, a new ritual, maybe, eventually, that clubbiness I‚Äôd envied in my mom‚Äôs games.I wrote a couple of weeks ago about how I think of this time of year as one of unclenching, of letting go of that coiled, withholding winter self and opening up to spring, which officially arrived this past Thursday in the Northern Hemisphere. The unclenching, I am now thinking, can sometimes be challenging. Deliberately moving from a familiar place to an unfamiliar one isn‚Äôt without its discomforts. I was reading recently about how, when a chick is ready to hatch, it develops an egg tooth, a sharp little structure on its beak that it uses to peck its way out of the egg. How incredible! How do we grow our own egg teeth, generate our own tools to crack our own shells, escape our too-tight enclosures and emerge into the light?THE LATEST NEWSTrump AdministrationColumbia University agreed to overhaul its protest policies and its Middle Eastern studies department, conceding to demands from the Trump administration.President Trump‚Äôs grudge with Columbia traces back to a failed real estate deal 25 years ago.President Trump revoked security clearances for prominent figures like Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and more.The administration shut down watchdog agencies in the Department of Homeland Security responsible for overseeing the president‚Äôs immigration crackdown.The Pentagon canceled a scheduled briefing for Elon Musk on top-secret plans for a potential war with China after The Times reported on the meeting.Trump announced that he would move some core functions of the Education Department, including student loans and special education services, to other agencies.Other Big StoriesBrendan George Ko for The New York TimesIn some parts of Los Angeles where wildfires turned neighborhoods to rubble, trees were the only thing left standing.George Foreman, the heavyweight boxing champion who parlayed his fame into a multimillion-dollar grill business, has died at 76.London‚Äôs Heathrow Airport has resumed operations, after a fire forced it to cancel or divert more than 1,000 flights.Bryan Johnson, an entrepreneur known for the extreme lengths he goes to to remain young, has long used confidentiality agreements to control his image.

Wirecutter‚Äôs experts recommend starting by considering what you want most from your shoes. If it‚Äôs distance, pay attention to cushioning. If it‚Äôs speed, focus on the weight and responsiveness. As for fit, it‚Äôs a good idea to be flexible about sizing: Every brand‚Äôs sizes are a little different. Use your normal running-shoe size as a starting point, but don‚Äôt be shy about sizing up (or, more rarely, down). To help inspire your search, we have recommendations for some of our favorite women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs running shoes ‚Äî including a pair stylish enough to wear every day. ‚Äî Seth BerkmanGAME OF THE WEEKSt. John‚Äôs guard RJ Luis Jr., left, and Arkansas forward Trevon Brazile.¬†Eric Canha/Imagn ImagesN.C.A.A. tournament: It‚Äôs the best weekend of the year for college basketball fans, with games on from noon till night in both the women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs tournaments.

Plus, a war briefing, Heathrow Airport and the Houston Rodeo.View in browser|nytimes.comMarch 21, 2025Good morning. Today you‚Äôll hear from our tax policy reporter, Andrew Duehren, about the tricky math of Republican tax cuts. We‚Äôre also covering a war briefing, Heathrow Airport and the Houston Rodeo.House Speaker Mike Johnson¬†Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesPicking tax cutsBy Andrew DuehrenI cover tax policy.Republicans have a math problem.There‚Äôs a long list of taxes they want to cut. But they can‚Äôt cut them all, because House Republicans have set a $4.5 trillion limit on the amount of money the federal budget can lose over the next 10 years to tax cuts.Even such a huge figure is not enough to encompass all of Republicans‚Äô ambitions, which include ending taxes on tips, trimming corporate payments and extending other treasured tax breaks. So members of Congress are negotiating over what they can actually squeeze into their bill ‚Äî and what they‚Äôll have to leave out.In today‚Äôs newsletter, I‚Äôll walk through the Republican wish list. I‚Äôll also explain how Senate Republicans want to use what is essentially a budgetary cheat code to make the math problem much easier.The old tax cutsMuch of the $4.5 trillion plan will be eaten up just by keeping the last round of tax cuts in place.In 2017, during President Trump‚Äôs first term, Republicans passed a bill that lowered taxes for individuals and corporations. Then, too, they were trying to cram their ambitions below a ceiling. So they scheduled many of the cuts, including a larger standard deduction and an expanded child tax credit, to expire at the end of 2025. They were betting that Congress would not let taxes go up on many Americans.They were right. But keeping taxes where they are now will cost roughly $4 trillion over 10 years. And a few business tax breaks are already phasing out. Restoring those would cost an additional $200 billion. That would leave just $300 billion for other ideas.There‚Äôs another problem: Republicans said their target was contingent on $2 trillion in spending cuts. If they slash less than that, the tax cut will have to shrink, too. Suddenly, the House plan does not seem so sweeping.The new tax cutsSource: Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget | Not all proposed tax cuts are shown. | By The New York TimesBut Trump wants to do more than just extend the tax cuts from his first term. During the presidential campaign, he outlined several new ideas, many of which call for exempting different types of income from taxation. These will be expensive. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group, has estimated their costs over 10 years:At least $100 billion not to tax tipsAt least $250 billion not to tax overtimeAt least $550 billion to lower taxes on Social Security benefitsAt least $200 billion to increase the deduction for state and local taxesIncluding all of these ideas in the bill would exceed the G.O.P. limit by hundreds of billions of dollars. So House Republicans are looking to raise other taxes ‚Äî by ending subsidies for electric vehicles, for example ‚Äî to compensate.They almost certainly can‚Äôt balance the scales, but they have a few options. They could abandon some of Trump‚Äôs pledges, continue the 2017 tax cuts for less than 10 years or do some combination of the two. Lawmakers are crunching the numbers to figure out what they can stomach.The Senate solutionRepublicans in the Senate believe they have an easy answer to this conundrum. They want to change the way tax cuts are counted. According to their proposal, keeping the old Trump tax cuts in place would cost nothing.How is that possible? Right now, scorekeepers in Washington evaluate future costs based on what the law says. Because much of the 2017 tax law ends this year, extending it would count as a new tax cut ‚Äî and tax cuts cost money.Republicans in the Senate see it differently. They argue that the cost of legislation should be compared to the price of policies that are in place right now. The old Trump tax cuts are currently in effect, they say, so maintaining the status quo should appear to cost $0, not $4 trillion. (My colleagues collected some of the most colorful comparisons for this maneuver. One budget expert said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like taking an expensive weeklong vacation and then assuming you can spend an extra $1,000 per day forever since you are no longer staying at the Plaza.‚Äù)Adopting this standard would make it a lot easier to craft a tax bill that, on paper, costs less than $4.5 trillion. Then only new measures, like not taxing tips, would add to the cost. But some Republicans in Congress warn that changing the score-keeping rules could destroy the last shreds of fiscal discipline in Washington, potentially expanding a deficit that most economists already believe is too large.The bottom lineIt‚Äôs unclear if Republicans will solve their arithmetic problem. Reaching a consensus could take months. With the tax cuts expiring at the end of the year, they face an unforgiving deadline. Failure would mean that Republicans would either oversee a tax increase on many Americans or turn to Democrats for a bipartisan fix. Republicans are hoping to avoid both of those outcomes.For more: Read how the tax cuts could affect your finances.THE LATEST NEWSEducation DepartmentAt the White House.¬†Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesPresident Trump, surrounded by schoolchildren in the East Room of the White House, signed an executive order that he said would ‚Äúbegin eliminating the federal Department of Education once and for all.‚Äù (A Times reporter asks: Can he really do that?)Only Congress, which created the department, can dissolve it. But Republican members would probably face blowback from education leaders in their districts.If the Education Department does go away, your student loans won‚Äôt: Another federal entity would take over the loan system.Late night hosts joked about Trump‚Äôs cuts to the department.ImmigrationA federal judge said the government had been ‚Äúwoefully insufficient‚Äù in turning over details about last weekend‚Äôs deportation flights. He gave the White House until Tuesday to explain itself.CBS News published the names of the 238 Venezuelan men aboard those flights.To invoke wartime deportation powers, Trump asserted that Venezuela‚Äôs government controls the Tren de Aragua gang. A U.S. intelligence assessment says that is not true.More on the Trump AdministrationThe Pentagon is set to brief Elon Musk on the U.S.‚Äôs plans for a potential war with China, some of the military‚Äôs most closely guarded secrets.A federal judge said the Social Security Administration could not give Musk‚Äôs government-slashing DOGE team access to sensitive records.A law firm bent to Trump‚Äôs demands. It said it will represent clients regardless of their politics and donate $40 million to causes Trump supports. He then dropped the executive order he had signed against the firm.TariffsTax revenues have fallen in China, leaving the government with less money to help consumers or exporters as Beijing braces for Trump‚Äôs tariffs.European Union officials said that they would delay retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey and other goods until mid-April, allowing more time for a deal.Middle EastAfter two months of an uneasy truce, Gaza is once again descending into war. Hamas launched a barrage of rockets at Tel Aviv as Israeli troops expanded their ground raids.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired the head of Israel‚Äôs domestic intelligence agency, who had been investigating officials in the prime minister‚Äôs office.More International NewsStranded passengers at Heathrow Airport.¬†James Manning/Press Association, via Getty ImagesHeathrow Airport in London has stopped all operations because a fire nearby caused a power outage. Around 300,000 people set to travel could be affected.Sudanese military forces recaptured the presidential palace in the capital, Khartoum. It could be a significant shift in Sudan‚Äôs civil war. See a video from inside Sudan.The Taliban released George Glezmann, an American airline mechanic who was detained while visiting Kabul in 2022 as a tourist.Shipping companies say they do not plan to return to the Red Sea until there is a broad Middle East peace accord that includes the Houthis.Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, is being held at The Hague.

Plus, a home like no other in the Philippines.View in browser|nytimes.comMarch 21, 2025By Emmett LindnerGood morning. Today, our Jerusalem bureau chief tells us what‚Äôs next for Gaza and we look at how Trump is trying to consolidate power.Plus, a home like no other in the Philippines.Palestinians fled northern Gaza yesterday after the Israeli military issued warnings to evacuate homes.¬†Saher Alghorra for The New York TimesHamas targeted Tel Aviv with rocketsHamas fired its first barrage of rockets in months into Israeli territory yesterday as Israeli troops expanded ground operations across Gaza. After the collapse of a two-month cease-fire, the fighting now looks as if it is escalating back to full-scale war.Despite street protests in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was expected to fire the head of Shin Bet, the domestic intelligence agency.For some insight on the situation, I reached out to Patrick Kingsley, our Jerusalem bureau chief.Patrick: We are back in a familiar standoff. Israel‚Äôs leadership wants both the safe return of Hamas‚Äôs hostages, as well as Hamas‚Äôs military defeat. But Hamas won‚Äôt hand over the hostages without Israel‚Äôs guaranteeing the group‚Äôs survival in Gaza. And Israel can‚Äôt defeat Hamas by force without harming many hostages. The cease-fire that collapsed this week was always likely to fall apart unless one of the sides softened its stance. But neither did. So Israel has returned to war in order to break Hamas‚Äôs resolve by force. And that leaves things roughly where they were before the cease-fire began in January: in a deadlock.Do the protests in Israel feel more impactful this time?For now, Netanyahu doesn‚Äôt seem swayed by the protesters calling for a new truce to save the hostages in Gaza. His biggest domestic priority is to pass a state budget by the end of the month. To do that, he needs the support of right-wing lawmakers, many of whom support the return to war and could abandon him if there‚Äôs another truce.Is President Trump‚Äôs Gaza plan still on the table?After proposing the expulsion of Gaza‚Äôs population in January, Trump has said that the idea was only a recommendation and that no Palestinians would be expelled. His aides also said that it was less a definitive plan of action than an attempt to provoke Arab leaders into suggesting a viable alternative.Several Arab leaders, led by Egypt, did later propose their own plan for postwar Gaza ‚Äî in which the territory would be governed by an apolitical committee as part of a Palestinian state. But the plan was vague, didn‚Äôt explain how Hamas would cede power and was swiftly rejected by the Israeli government, which seeks to avoid discussion of Palestinian statehood.Smoke rising from the attack on an airfield in Russia‚Äôs Saratov region, yesterday.¬†ReutersRussia and Ukraine traded strikes as talks are plannedUkraine attacked an airfield deep inside Russia, officials said yesterday, as the U.S. worked to iron out a partial cease-fire. In Ukraine, Russian drones killed at least five people and injured 26 others, according to local authorities.The Kremlin said yesterday that preparations were underway for a new round of Russia-U.S. talks that would be held on Monday in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine will also send representatives there to meet with U.S. officials.A U.S. proposal: President Trump has floated the idea of controlling Ukraine‚Äôs nuclear power plants. What would it mean if the U.S. took them over?Eric Lee/The New York TimesHow Trump is trying to consolidate powerPresident Trump is trying to cement control over the courts, Congress and even U.S. society and culture. But his latest target ‚Äî the courts ‚Äî has been described by constitutional scholars and historians as perhaps the most alarming power play to date.Trump‚Äôs widening interpretation of presidential power has become the defining characteristic of his second term.More on TrumpA judge ordered the Trump administration to explain why it didn‚Äôt halt deportation flights as directed, and appeared close to possibly holding the administration in contempt.President Trump is expected to sign an order to dismantle the Education Department.Trump and Republicans are pushing new laws and policies that crack down on free speech at universities.Meet Steve Davis, a longtime Elon Musk loyalist who effectively runs the government efficiency program.

Now, Syrians named on any of those lists are sharing the news proudly.Canada: Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, has earned the nickname ‚ÄúCaptain Canada‚Äù for defending his country against Trump.Philippines: Former President Rodrigo Duterte now sits in a cell in The Hague.

Plus, executive power, Volodymyr Zelensky and the MetroCard.View in browser|nytimes.comMarch 20, 2025Good morning. Today you‚Äôll hear from the Times‚Äôs chief economics correspondent, Ben Casselman, who weighs evidence about a possible recession. We‚Äôre also covering executive power, Volodymyr Zelensky and the MetroCard.On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.¬†Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse ‚Äî Getty ImagesA Trump recession?By Ben CasselmanI cover the economy.Is the U.S. economy headed for a recession? Stocks have plunged. So have measures of consumer and business confidence. Forecasters expect slower growth, higher unemployment and faster inflation than they did just a few months ago ‚Äî and yesterday, policymakers at the Federal Reserve said they agreed.Source: LSEG Data & Analytics | By The New York TimesThe administration has announced and then delayed tariffs; it has ended and then restored programs. Even some experts who are sympathetic to President Trump‚Äôs aims worry that businesses will pull back on hiring and investing in the face of so much uncertainty ‚Äî a word that the chairman of the Fed used repeatedly in a news conference yesterday.Most forecasters still don‚Äôt expect a recession. But they say the chances of one have risen sharply ‚Äî a turnabout from when Trump took office. How likely is a downturn? In today‚Äôs newsletter, I‚Äôll explore three big questions about the Trump economy.1. Actions versus feelings?So far, the evidence of a slowdown comes mostly from ‚Äúsoft‚Äù indicators. These are surveys showing that businesses are more reluctant to hire and invest, and that workers are more worried about losing their jobs.‚ÄúHard‚Äù indicators ‚Äî measures of actual activity ‚Äî haven‚Äôt shown the same weakness. Job growth was solid in February, for example. Retail sales slumped in January but rebounded last month, although less than forecasters had expected.Attitudes almost always change before actual behavior does. A company that loses a contract today probably won‚Äôt lay off its staff tomorrow; an employee who hears a rumor of job cuts might not immediately cancel a long-planned vacation. And even when behavior does shift, it takes time to show up clearly in the economic data.Source: University of Michigan | Data is monthly through March 2025; March 2025 data is preliminary. | By The New York TimesBut it is also possible that falling confidence won‚Äôt ever translate into real-world decisions. Consumer confidence was low through much of the Biden administration, for example, but actual spending never faltered. And evidence suggests that sentiment measures have become less reliable in an era of extreme partisanship.2. How determined is Trump?Trump made tariffs a centerpiece of his campaign last year. But many people on Wall Street didn‚Äôt believe he would follow through ‚Äî in part because if he did, stocks would fall and Trump would reverse course.So far, that has been a losing bet. In his first term, Trump worried when markets fell and bragged when they rose. But when stocks fell after tariff announcements this month, he disregarded the selloff and refused to back down. ‚ÄúMarkets are going to go up and they‚Äôre going to go down,‚Äù he told reporters last week. He and members of his administration now suggest that a period of economic pain is necessary to balance the economy. (Hardly any economists agree.)Still, Trump could change tactics if the slump worsened.3. Is there a cushion?Coming into this year, most forecasters expected economic output to grow about 2 percent, adjusted for inflation. That‚Äôs slower than the 2.5 percent it grew last year, but it‚Äôs a long way from a recession.Yet even before Trump took office, some forecasters warned that the economy was not as strong as well-known indicators like the unemployment rate suggested. Hiring was slowing; the housing market was frozen in place; consumers were saving less to maintain their spending.Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis | Data is a biweekly average through March 19, 2025. | By The New York Times‚ÄúAll of these things were pretty obvious even in December,‚Äù said Neil Dutta of Renaissance Macro Research, a financial firm. He argues that a slowdown in growth was inevitable this year, regardless of who won the election ‚Äî which would mean that Trump is operating with less of an economic buffer than most people believe.The economy has repeatedly proved doubters wrong in recent years, and it may do so again. But it doesn‚Äôt take a recession to cause real hardship. Even a mere slowdown in growth could leave hundreds of thousands out of work ‚Äî and, if history is any guide, send Trump‚Äôs approval ratings through the floor. That‚Äôs the kind of outcome presidents usually do everything in their power to avoid.(Why are economists so bad at forecasting recessions? I tried to answer that question in this piece I wrote a few years ago.)THE LATEST NEWSGovernment OverhaulPresident Trump¬†Doug Mills/The New York TimesTrump is trying to consolidate control over the courts, over Congress, and, in some ways, over American culture, Times political correspondents write.Trump plans to sign an executive order today instructing the head of the Education Department, Linda McMahon, to begin dismantling the agency. The department cannot be closed without Congress‚Äôs approval.The administration appointed two officials who helped dismantle U.S.A.I.D. to be the agency‚Äôs new leaders.What happens after a judge reinstates fired federal employees? Rather than returning to work, many are trapped in limbo.Steve Davis, a longtime Elon Musk loyalist, is effectively the leader of DOGE. Musk has praised Davis‚Äôs cost-cutting abilities by comparing him to chemotherapy. ‚ÄúA little chemo can save your life; a lot of chemo could kill you,‚Äù Musk said.ImmigrationA federal judge granted the Justice Department another day to reveal the details of two deportation flights that may have defied his orders.U.S. officials detained a Georgetown scholar from India, who is in the U.S. legally on a student visa, and accused him of ‚Äúspreading Hamas propaganda.‚ÄùThe Trump administration wanted to move the deportation case of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate and pro-Palestinian protester, to Louisiana. Instead, a judge transferred the case to New Jersey.More on the Trump AdministrationThe administration plans to suspend about $175 million in funding to the University of Pennsylvania, apparently because of the school‚Äôs past support for a transgender swimmer.Musk donated to members of Congress who support impeaching federal judges who oppose Trump‚Äôs actions.The Justice Department plans to restore gun rights to some convicts, an issue that became contentious after agency officials sought to reinstate Mel Gibson‚Äôs firearm access.The Kennedy assassination files that Trump released this week offers little new information about the shooting, but they do reveal some details about C.I.A. spycraft.In the rush to release the files, the administration publicized the personal information, including Social Security numbers, of people who are still alive.War in UkraineVolodymyr Zelensky agreed to halt attacks on Russian energy infrastructure in a limited cease-fire also backed by the Kremlin. It‚Äôs not clear when the pause will start.In a phone call with Zelensky, Trump suggested Ukraine hand over control of its energy facilities, including nuclear plants, to the U.S.Putin has offered few concessions to Ukraine. Experts worry that Russia is discussing a cease-fire only to buy time for the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship to collapse.Middle EastIsraeli ground troops pushed into Gaza and took partial control of a corridor in the center of the territory, reclaiming an area it had held before the cease-fire.Thousands of Israelis gathered outside Parliament to call for a renewed cease-fire. The demonstrations are a sign that national solidarity over the war is fraying.Trump said the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen would be ‚Äúcompletely annihilated‚Äù by the U.S. and warned Tehran to stop supplying the militia with equipment.More International NewsDonald Trump Jr.¬†Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesDonald Trump Jr. visited Serbia to show his support for the country‚Äôs embattled leader.

Please see my comments below:&nbsp;Edu &amp; target job relevance score should be the similarity between ISCED description and SOC description (instead of JD). So we will have a matrix again. Further, we may want to set some categories and threshold, instead of using the similarity score directly. If you are using the identity matrix now (i.e., {if the same SOC, =1; if not, =0}, you won‚Äôt be bothered by the relevance score any more, no? We will improve this vanilla approach to a more comprehensive matrix (by a combination of similarity computation and human judgement) at a later stage. If one doesn‚Äôt have educational information, drop the individual from the database. Therefore, you won‚Äôt have no edu + work experience records any more, right? If a case (not an individual) has edu only but no work experience, that should be treated as fresh graduate, according to our discussion yesterday.A case not having job description for a certain experience is not a problem any more, isn‚Äôt it? We don‚Äôt use it any more. Gavin, please do code review for Kai, strictly following my instructions. Zhang Kai, I‚Äôd suggest you seek help from Abdur and Ali to speed things up.&nbsp;&nbsp;From: Kai Zhang &lt;kzhang@oxbridge-econ.com&gt;Date: Wednesday, 19 March 2025 at 11:29‚ÄØAMTo: admin@oxbridge-econ.com &lt;admin@oxbridge-econ.com&gt;, shing@firstcapital.asia &lt;shing@firstcapital.asia&gt;Cc: Gavin Li &lt;gli@oxbridge-econ.com&gt;Subject: Re: Smartcareers algorithm debug and improvementDear Tiffany,&nbsp;Please kindly find my reply to part of your comments in blue below.

Thus, the update of thresholds on the app side may not be easy. For test purpose, I will firstly still use the same threshold as historical data.&nbsp; b) Ëã•Êõ¥Ê≠£ÂêéË°®Áé∞‰ªç‰∏çÁêÜÊÉ≥ÔºåÂàôÂèØ‰ª•Â∞ÜÁé∞ÊúâapproachÊîπ‰∏∫mapping table approach&nbsp;2Ôºâoccupation relevance score: ÁÆóÊ≥ï‰∏çÂåπÈÖçÔºåÁõ∏ÂÖ≥ÊÄßÊÄª‰ΩìÂÅèÈ´òhistorical dataÁÆóÊ≥ïÊòØtarget job title+description vs. past job title+descriptionÔºå‰ΩÜÂ∫îÁî®Á´ØÁî®Êà∑Ê≤°ÊúâËæìÂÖ•job descriptionÔºå‰ΩøÁî®ÁöÑÊòØtarget job title+SOC description vs. past job title+description You need to give me summary statistics for the latter and example relevance scores for the former. For ‚ÄúÁÆóÊ≥ï‰∏çÂåπÈÖç‚Äù, during my test over 11 CVs, there are highs and lows. Thus, it is hard to tell whether this will cause a severe problem. But the algorithm mismatch exists.&nbsp;By saying ‚ÄúÁõ∏ÂÖ≥ÊÄßÊÄª‰ΩìÂÅèÈ´ò‚Äù, I was mentioning the occupation relevance score is generally higher than education relevance score. That is, when scaling experience score using occupation relevance score, the decline will be smaller than scaling education score using education relevance score. &nbsp;For example, a completely irrelevant education will be scaled by 0.1, but a completely irrelevant experience may still have a relevance score at ~0.3 and will thus be scaled by ~0.3. In this case, this irrelevant experience will be ~3 times worth more than this irrelevant education.&nbsp;Thus, I am not sure whether this is problematic, but just to mention this potential issue.ÊîπËøõËÆ°ÂàíÔºö&nbsp; a) ËÆæÁΩÆÈòàÂÄºÂØπrelevance scoreÂàÜÊ°£Âπ∂ËµãÂÄº&nbsp; b) Ëã•Êõ¥Ê≠£ÂêéË°®Áé∞‰ªç‰∏çÁêÜÊÉ≥ÔºåÂàôÂèØ‰ª•Â∞ÜÁé∞ÊúâapproachÊîπ‰∏∫mapping table approach I proposed this, and I thought you‚Äôve changed the approach to this, no?

I thought you‚Äôve dropped cases without education information, no? If they are not excluded, the distribution should definitely be distorted. You need to tell me how much percentage has missing fields (I think the most problematic is missing education info?). &nbsp;I just checked the historical data and noticed that blank educations are removed, but experiences with no education information (experiences that belongs to CV holders with blank education field) were not excepted when evaluating distribution. These cases take ~8.0% of the total cases. This will also be fixed on Fri (Mar 21).&nbsp;Another group of problems is cases with no experience title or description. Cases with no experience title takes ~6.3%, and cases with no experience description takes ~11.6%.

These three groups of people are treated separately, and they will have their own different distribution for the same occupation*industry combination. This also addresses my previous concerns about seniority. &nbsp;In terms of the front-end, we will add another choice on the first page: the user needs to choose his/her own level.

Plus, a push against India‚Äôs ‚Äúboss husbands.‚ÄùView in browser|nytimes.comMarch 20, 2025By Emmett LindnerGood morning. We‚Äôre covering a limited cease-fire deal for Ukraine and Canada‚Äôs bid to join Europe‚Äôs military buildup.Plus, a push against India‚Äôs ‚Äúboss husbands.‚ÄùA power plant in eastern Ukraine that was hit by Russian strikes this week. ¬†Nicole Tung for The New York TimesUkraine agreed to halt strikes on energy sitesPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine agreed yesterday to Russia‚Äôs offer of a mutual pause in attacks on energy targets for 30 days as a step toward a broader cease-fire. He discussed the pause during a phone call with President Trump, who described the conversation as ‚Äúvery good.‚ÄùThe two leaders spoke a day after Trump‚Äôs conversation with Vladimir Putin, Russia‚Äôs leader. It was the first time Trump and Zelensky had spoken since their disastrous Oval Office meeting last month.Zelensky called the conversation ‚Äúpositive, very substantive and frank,‚Äù making clear that he had thanked Trump for America‚Äôs support.Trump also floated the idea that the U.S. could take control of Ukrainian power plants ‚Äî an idea that Ukrainian energy experts said was probably unworkable. Technical teams will meet in Saudi Arabia ‚Äúin the coming days,‚Äù a White House statement said. They will discuss broadening the pause to cover activity in the Black Sea, ‚Äúon the way to a full cease-fire.‚ÄùWhat‚Äôs next: Zelensky said that the agreement would need U.S. monitoring to work, and that Kyiv would prepare a list of sites that needed protection. ‚ÄúJust the assertion and the word of Putin that he will not strike energy sites is too little,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWar has made us practical people.‚ÄùAnalysis: Most of what Putin agreed to on Tuesday‚Äôs call with Trump was spun as a concession, but the Russian leader didn‚Äôt really give any ground.More on TrumpThe attorney general labeled recent attacks on Tesla dealerships across the U.S. as acts of ‚Äúdomestic terrorism‚Äù directed against Elon Musk.Trump has hinted that he‚Äôd soon be meeting Xi Jinping, China‚Äôs leader. But Beijing is still wondering what he wants.Trump‚Äôs oldest son visited Belgrade, the site of a Trump International Hotel project, and expressed his supported for Serbia‚Äôs embattled leader.President John F. Kennedy‚Äôs grandson criticized Trump, Republican lawmakers and the news media after a new trove of government files about Kennedy‚Äôs assassination was released. The files offer few revelations so far.The star pianist Andr√°s Schiff has boycotted performing in the U.S. because of Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúunbelievable bullying.‚ÄùTrump‚Äôs hostility to Canada is hurting New York City‚Äôs tourism industry.Track Trump‚Äôs actions since he took office.An armored personnel carrier for export to Ukraine in 2023 at a plant in Ontario.¬†Carlos Osorio/ReutersCanada moves closer to EuropeAs Canada is increasingly threatened by Trump, it could reach a deal that would lessen its dependence on the U.S. Advanced talks that would let Canada join the E.U.‚Äôs new project to expand its military industry are underway.An agreement would allow the country to help build European fighter jets and other equipment at its own industrial facilities.The goal is to strengthen the E.U. defense industry and offer Canada a credible alternative to the U.S., according to officials with direct knowledge of the talks. Canada‚Äôs new leader, Prime Minister Mark Carney, this week made Paris and London the destinations of his first overseas trip since taking office on Friday, calling Canada ‚Äúthe most European of non-European countries.‚ÄùBackground: Canada has been a regular U.S. contractor, and its factories produce munitions, tanks, aircraft, technological defense systems and navy ships. A 2022 review found that the top destination of its military equipment, by far, was the U.S.What‚Äôs next: The initiative and partnership will take years to bear fruit. E.U. defense has been falling behind because of U.S. dominance and underinvestment, a dire situation that has become more apparent after the drive to arm Ukraine depleted the arsenals of E.U. members.Palestinians at a checkpoint at the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza, last month. ¬†Saher Alghorra for The New York TimesIsrael seized part of a central corridor in GazaYesterday, Israeli forces took over parts of a major corridor that divides Gaza, in the most significant ground operation since the collapse of a cease-fire with Hamas.The military said soldiers had begun ‚Äútargeted ground activities‚Äù along the road, known as the Netzarim Corridor, to create a ‚Äúpartial buffer zone‚Äù in the territory between the north and south.Context: Israel has not returned to a full-scale war in Gaza, but, by stepping up attacks, Israeli leaders appeared to be trying to force Hamas to agree to more favorable terms for a settlement.In Jerusalem, thousands of Israeli protesters called for a renewed cease-fire.Photos from the Gaza strikes: A cease-fire spared Palestinians the task of identifying bodies. Our photographers captured this grim return to the past.MORE TOP NEWSSoldiers outside Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in January. ¬†Guerchom Ndebo for The New York TimesAfrica: The leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda called for a cease-fire between Congo‚Äôs army and a Rwandan-backed rebel group.Turkey: Authorities arrested the mayor of Istanbul, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan‚Äôs biggest rival, just before he was set to be named the opposition‚Äôs candidate in the next presidential election.U.S.: The Fed extended its pause on rate cuts as Trump‚Äôs aggressive approach to tariffs and other policies fuel uncertainty about the economic outlook.Tech: The E.U. accused Apple and Google of unfairly blocking out smaller competitors, adding to tensions between Europe and the U.S.Pope: It does not seem to matter that the Vatican said that Pope Francis‚Äôs health had improved. Conspiracy theories run wild.Myanmar: The leader of an armed group representing Rohingya Muslims was arrested in a raid in Bangladesh and charged under an antiterrorism law.Mexico: Lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to ban traditional bullfighting in Mexico City. A cape-only, nonviolent option is allowed.U.K.: Two men were found guilty of stealing and selling an 18-karat gold toilet in 2019.Climate: The past 10 years have been the 10 hottest in nearly 200 years of record-keeping, a U.N. agency reported.Brazil: Eduardo Bolsonaro, a Brazilian congressman and a son of the country‚Äôs former president, said that he would seek political asylum in the U.S.SportsMohamed Salah of Liverpool.¬†Paul Childs/REUTERS, via Action ImagesSoccer: Liverpool is heading for a summer transfer overhaul despite its impending Premier League championship win.Tennis: A lawsuit led by Novak Djokovic is threatening to rock tennis to its core. We broke down the details.Golf: The upcoming Masters has the chance to be the biggest opportunity of Rory McIlroy‚Äôs remarkable, yet frustrating, career.MORNING READDibyangshu Sarkar/Agence France-Presse ‚Äî Getty ImagesIn Paraswara, a village in a rural corner of India, 12 men were sworn in this month to form a local government. A video of the ceremony went viral and caused a scandal because half of those men hadn‚Äôt been elected ‚Äî their wives had.The sidelining of women in rural Indian politics is nothing new, but some are starting to push back against ‚Äúboss husbands.‚ÄùLives lived: Anthony Dolan, who as Ronald Reagan‚Äôs chief speechwriter deployed the phrase ‚Äúevil empire‚Äù in 1983 to describe the Soviet Union, died at 76.CONVERSATION STARTERSVideo by APPLE TV+Treats and shackles: The food on the hit show ‚ÄúSeverance‚Äù is a chilling tool of manipulation, suppression and distraction.The dream of Forever 21: Anything the fast-fashion retailer lacked in cool or quality it made up for with the thrill of the hunt.Tech for babies: Many lists of baby gear mandate certain items. Here‚Äôs what one parent felt helped the most.We hope you‚Äôve enjoyed this newsletter, which is made possible through subscriber support. Subscribe to The New York Times.ARTS AND IDEASUbisoftA gorgeous digital window into feudal JapanOpen-world video games tend to have a central story, augmented with mostly extraneous side quests and hidden areas. Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows, which takes place in 16th-century Japan, reverses the formula. Here, the story takes a back seat to historical renderings that are as accurate as you‚Äôll find without airfare.As players step into the shoes of an African-born samurai and a young ninja on a tour of vengeance, the plot is outshone by the game‚Äôs fascinating picture of this vibrant era. The game comes out today in most countries.

These three groups of people are treated separately, and they will have their own different distribution for the same occupation*industry combination. This also addresses my previous concerns about seniority. &nbsp;In terms of the front-end, we will add another choice on the first page: the user needs to choose his/her own level. This should be easy to implement, right? Yes, let's do that, and see where it leads us, BUT note for a recruiting perspective: &nbsp;&lt;= 3 years of work experience),&nbsp;intermediate (&gt;3 &amp; &lt;= 8 years),&nbsp;advanced (&gt;8 &amp; &lt;= 15 years), senior level (&gt;15 years).&nbsp;&nbsp;shing&nbsp;Shing Chow CHENGManaging DirectorFirstCapital Asia Investments Ltdhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/shingchowchenghttps://www.firstcapital.asia/On 19/3/2025 5:59 am, admin@oxbridge-econ.com wrote:Hi Kai, thanks for the test.

Plus, Putin, the J.F.K. files and astronauts.View in browser|nytimes.comMarch 19, 2025By German LopezGood morning. We‚Äôre covering Trump and the judicial branch ‚Äî as well as Putin, the J.F.K. files and astronauts.Chief Justice John Roberts and President Trump.¬†Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesThe judiciary‚Äôs rolePresident Trump‚Äôs latest adversary is the judicial branch.Yesterday, Trump called for the impeachment of a judge who had ruled against him, earning a rare rebuke from the chief justice of the Supreme Court. The administration had ignored the judge‚Äôs order to stop deportations over the weekend, saying the government would heed only his written command, not a spoken one.It was hardly the first sign of trouble. Trump‚Äôs lawyers have peddled distortions and lies in court, as my colleague Charlie Savage explained. They‚Äôve also said a judge can‚Äôt meddle in Trump‚Äôs work protecting the United States from threats. His aides have suggested that the president can ignore rulings.All three branches of government are, in theory, equal; Congress passes laws, presidents enforce them and judges interpret them. That‚Äôs the norm, anyway. Historically, presidents almost always respect what the courts say, even if they disagree. They obey judges. Their representatives don‚Äôt lie in court or claim exemption from judicial oversight.But the United States may soon find out what happens when those norms no longer hold. Trump and his lawyers are challenging the balance of power among the branches of government. Experts worry this is the beginning of a constitutional crisis.Is it? Today‚Äôs newsletter looks at the signs of peril ‚Äî and the signs that America‚Äôs constitutional order is holding up for now.The dangersJudicial review is the concept that judges can strike down laws if they violate the Constitution. The notion came from the Supreme Court‚Äôs 1803 decision in Marbury v. Madison, and it made the court a backstop to the excesses of Congress or the presidency.But the decision came with a quirk: The Supreme Court can‚Äôt actually enforce its rulings. It relies on the president and Congress to believe in the courts and take their judgments seriously. Some presidents have challenged the court in minor ways, and Andrew Jackson defied it brazenly when he allowed Georgia to expel Cherokees from their land.But presidents have unhappily followed the Supreme Court‚Äôs judgments over the past century and a half. Barack Obama abided by the court‚Äôs decision after it limited Obamacare‚Äôs requirement that health insurance plans cover contraception. In response to rulings, George W. Bush adjusted his plans to put Guant√°namo detainees on trial.Trump and his allies question that tradition. The administration has ignored a raft of lower court rulings over deportations, agency staffing and government funding. Trump himself has suggested that he‚Äôs above the courts. ‚ÄúHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law,‚Äù he said online. His vice president, JD Vance, has said that ‚Äújudges aren‚Äôt allowed to control the executive‚Äôs legitimate power.‚Äù Vance adapted an apocryphal quote attributed to Andrew Jackson: ‚ÄúThe chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.‚ÄùAll of this, experts say, amounts to a red flag for the constitutional order.Averting crisisStill, America may not be in a crisis yet. Republicans in Congress have not actually impeached any judges. A judge has not yet held Trump or anyone in his administration in contempt. The administration has not defied the Supreme Court ‚Äî only lower court orders; that still breaks dangerous new ground, but those rulings are not always final.Some Trump supporters argue that he is challenging a narrow aspect of the judicial branch, not the whole constitutional system. For years, experts and members of both parties have complained about how much power lower courts have. A single federal district judge from Sherman, Texas, for instance, can stop an executive order across the whole country, as when a jurist stopped an Obama-era rule requiring overtime pay for millions of workers. Litigants can shop around for sympathetic judges, all but guaranteeing their victory until a higher court weighs in.Even believers of judicial review can, and do, take issue with this dynamic.The red lineThe real danger, then, is if Trump openly defies a Supreme Court ruling. That will send a clear message: The president is above the judicial branch. America‚Äôs constitutional system requires the president to believe in checks and balances; it falls apart if he doesn‚Äôt.More on the courtsTrump is already undercutting the separation of powers, legal scholars say. Their question now is: How will that change the country?Justice Department lawyers again refused to tell a federal judge when two planes of deportees took off last weekend. The judge, who is trying to determine whether the government defied his order to halt the deportations, gave them until today to comply.A federal judge ruled that Elon Musk‚Äôs dismantling of U.S.A.I.D. was likely unconstitutional and ordered the agency to partially resume its operations.Judges also blocked the Trump administration from barring transgender people from the military and ordered the Education Department to restore some grants it terminated in a purge of D.E.I. programs.THE LATEST NEWSImmigrationThe Trump administration says the people it deported to El Salvador were all gang members. But it‚Äôs not clear how officials determined that.‚ÄúWe finally got you‚Äù: Immigration agents arrested an undocumented woman in Denver whose public claim of sanctuary in a church made national news during Trump‚Äôs first term.Government OverhaulIn the Oval Office. ¬†Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesTrump fired the two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, a rejection of the regulator‚Äôs traditional independence.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not alone‚Äù: Federal workers have taken to forums on Reddit to vent and share information about Trump‚Äôs cuts.DOGE, after criticism, reinstated details on its website about grants it canceled.More on the Trump AdministrationTrump and his allies are trying to cripple his opponents using executive orders, investigations and threats.Attorney General Pam Bondi called recent attacks on Tesla dealerships acts of domestic terrorism directed at Musk.Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has suggested that poultry farmers should let bird flu run through their flocks to identify birds that may be immune. Scientists say this would be disastrous.The administration threated to withhold funding from New York‚Äôs mass transit system if the M.T.A. did not answer questions about subway crime.Republicans named Vance to lead the party‚Äôs fund-raising, an apparent first for a vice president.War in UkraineIn a call with Trump, Vladimir Putin agreed to pause strikes on energy infrastructure if Ukraine did the same. He stopped short of accepting a broader cease-fire.Russia and Ukraine have attacked each other‚Äôs infrastructure since the call, BBC News reports.The U.S. ended funding to track thousands of Ukrainian children whom Russia has abducted, and officials or contractors may have deleted a database about them.Israel-Hamas WarIn Gaza City.¬†Saher Alghorra for The New York TimesIsrael‚Äôs renewed attacks on Gaza killed more than 400 people, the enclave‚Äôs health authority said. That would make yesterday one of the deadliest days of the war.Talks between Israel and Hamas to extend a cease-fire have stalled. Israel appears to have returned to war to force concessions, Patrick Kingsley and Ronen Bergman write.In a televised address, Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that more attacks were coming. ‚ÄúThis is only the beginning,‚Äù he said.More International NewsLawmakers in Mexico City banned traditional bullfighting.

Plus, Ohtani‚Äôs star power in Japan.View in browser|nytimes.comMarch 19, 2025By Emmett LindnerGood morning. We‚Äôre covering Putin‚Äôs agreement to pause attacks targeting Ukraine‚Äôs energy sites and Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.Plus, Ohtani‚Äôs star power in Japan.A Ukrainian thermal power plant damaged by Russian missile strikes last year.¬†Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesRussia agreed to pause strikes on energy in UkrainePresident Vladimir Putin of Russia agreed yesterday on a call with President Trump to halt strikes on Ukraine‚Äôs energy infrastructure for 30 days, as long as Ukraine does the same, the Kremlin said. Putin declined for now to agree to a broader cease-fire that the U.S. and Ukraine had proposed.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said he was open to the truce on attacks on energy infrastructure.My colleague Paul Sonne, who covers Russia, told me that Putin told Trump ‚Äúthat the ‚Äòkey condition‚Äô to resolving the conflict was an end to military and intelligence aid to Ukraine by the West.‚Äù Paul added that this path ‚Äúwould essentially make Ukraine perpetually vulnerable to Russia.‚ÄùThe White House called the pause a first step toward peace, but the outcome seemed to fall well short of what Trump had suggested was possible before the two leaders spoke.A partial cease-fire would benefit both nations. Ukraine has struggled with Russia‚Äôs repeated attacks on its energy grid. The pause would also give Russia a break from Ukraine‚Äôs strikes on its oil and gas facilities, jeopardizing a crucial revenue stream.Related:The U.S. is seeking access to Ukrainian minerals, which require extensive energy to process. The Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia power plant in southern Ukraine could help with that goal, Kyiv says.Russia significantly stepped up its sabotage campaign as it sought to pressure Europe and the U.S. to curb their support for Ukraine, a study found.Bodies of Palestinians killed in airstrikes.¬†Saher Alghorra for The New York TimesIsrael bombed Gaza as the cease-fire broke downIsraeli forces launched intense aerial attacks across the Gaza Strip yesterday, ending a temporary cease-fire with Hamas that began in January and raising the prospect of a return to all-out war.More than 400 people, including children, were killed, according to Gazan officials. It was one of the war‚Äôs deadliest single-day tolls. The office of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said he had ordered the military operation after the ‚Äúrepeated refusal‚Äù by Hamas to release the remaining hostages. ‚ÄúThis is just the beginning,‚Äù Netanyahu said.Hamas accused Israel of overturning the cease-fire and ‚Äúexposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate.‚ÄùContext: Talks on extending the cease-fire stalled because Hamas refused to release significant numbers of hostages until Israel promised to end the war permanently ‚Äî a commitment Israel would not make unless Hamas agreed to give up power in Gaza. Now, Israel appears to have returned to war in an attempt to crush Hamas‚Äôs hopes of retaining control of the territory.Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesTop Supreme Court judge rebuked TrumpSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts yesterday admonished President Trump for threatening to impeach the federal judge who ordered a halt to the deportation of hundreds of migrants to El Salvador. The chief justice rarely issues public statements.‚ÄúFor more than two centuries,‚Äù Roberts said, ‚Äúit has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.‚ÄùContext: The deportation case has emerged as a flashpoint in a larger debate over presidential power and the role of courts to review how that power is applied.More on TrumpTrump said that a U.S. recession might be worth the cost.

Plus, attacks in Gaza, DOGE cuts and sushi in Ukraine.View in browser|nytimes.comMarch 18, 2025By German LopezGood morning. We‚Äôre covering Trump‚Äôs immigration crackdown ‚Äî as well as attacks in Gaza, DOGE cuts and sushi in Ukraine.Immigrants deported from the U.S. arriving in Panama City.¬†Matias Delacroix/Associated PressImmigration crackdownPresident Trump‚Äôs promised immigration crackdown is here. Over the past two weeks, his administration has pushed against the limits of executive power ‚Äî and surpassed them, critics say ‚Äî to kick more people out of the country.The administration has readied two facilities in Texas to again detain immigrant families, including children, my colleagues Jazmine Ulloa and Miriam Jordan reported yesterday. It invoked an arcane law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, to deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to a prison in El Salvador, despite a judge‚Äôs order. It deported a kidney transplant expert who works at Brown University, also despite a judge‚Äôs order. It detained a green-card-holding leader of last year‚Äôs pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University.Presidents have not traditionally treated illegal immigration as a national security issue, but Trump says migrants pose a threat. He claims without evidence that other countries have deliberately emptied their prisons and asylums to fuel an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù of the United States.Today‚Äôs newsletter examines the new rationale for the crackdown ‚Äî and the way it is taking shape.Stretching powersIn each of the examples above, the Trump administration has gone further, or plans to go further, than previous administrations felt they could:Family detention: The administration has indicated that it will contest a 20-day limit on how long child migrants can be detained. Trump‚Äôs allies have long decried such limits as imposing a ‚Äúcatch and release‚Äù policy that forces the government to free unauthorized migrants.Venezuelan deportations: To evict migrants without a hearing, the administration cited a wartime law used most recently to intern Japanese Americans during World War II. (The United States is not at war with Venezuela.) It dispatched planeloads of migrants over the weekend despite a court order that tried to stop the deportations. White House officials argue that a judge can‚Äôt restrict the president‚Äôs national security powers, and even if one could, the order came too late. They stuck to those arguments in a court hearing.The nephrologist‚Äôs deportation: The government deported Rasha Alawieh, a Lebanese kidney transplant expert at Brown University, over the weekend. She had a valid visa, and a court tried to block the move. The administration said that it deported her because she attended a Hezbollah leader‚Äôs funeral during a trip to Lebanon.The student activists: The administration detained Mahmoud Khalil, a leader of pro-Palestinian protests, this month. Another student activist at Columbia, Ranjani Srinivasan, fled to Canada after immigration agents revoked her visa and showed up at her home. Supporters of Khalil and Srinivasan argue that the First Amendment protects their right to protest. But the Trump administration counters that immigrants, particularly those it deems national security threats, do not enjoy the full freedom of speech. It suggests that the activists supported a designated terrorist group, Hamas. (Read more about Khalil‚Äôs story and why he was targeted.)A proposed revival for the travel ban: During his first term, Trump repeatedly tried to ban visitors from mostly Muslim countries, citing the threat of terrorism. The courts blocked the first two attempts. But the Supreme Court eventually allowed a ban on eight countries, six of them predominantly Muslim, to remain. Last week, my colleagues Charlie Savage and Ken Bensinger reported on a plan to bring back the ban ‚Äî and grow it to cover 43 countries.In some ways, these examples continue a longstanding executive tradition: Presidents often use national security concerns to expand their powers. George W. Bush, for example, pointed to worries about another attack like Sept. 11 to detain and torture people without trial, drawing criticism from civil rights advocates.Preparing for moreThe extraordinary measures are needed to deliver on a campaign pledge, Trump says. He has struggled to execute the mass deportations he promised. In fact, he has deported migrants at a lower rate than Joe Biden did, as this chart shows:Source: ICE | Data is through March 8, 2025; no data available for Dec. 2024. | By The New York Times(The Times broke down what the data shows about Trump‚Äôs deportation efforts so far here.)Some of that failure is a result of the administration‚Äôs success. Fewer people are crossing the border illegally, leaving fewer people to ship back. But Trump vowed to deport not just recent arrivals but also those who‚Äôve been in the country for months or years. He has so far failed to kick out much of that second population, which enjoys stronger legal protections, such as rights to specific immigration court hearings, than people caught at the border do.By claiming major new executive powers, Trump has set the groundwork to bypass more legal protections and execute his vision. Before Trump‚Äôs election, his allies talked about deporting at least one million people a year. Experts always doubted he could reach those numbers as quickly as hoped. But with a different view of what is legal, he eventually might.More on immigrationA Justice Department lawyer refused to answer a judge‚Äôs questions about the timing of the deportation flights. The judge asked officials to provide him a timeline by noon today.Two of the flights carrying Venezuelan migrants were in the air when the judge ordered them to turn back, and one had yet to take off, a Times analysis found.El Salvador‚Äôs president, Nayib Bukele, boasted on social media about accepting Trump‚Äôs deportees into his prisons. He has described himself in the past as the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs coolest dictator.‚ÄùTHE LATEST NEWSIsrael-Hamas WarIn Gaza City.¬†Saher Alghorra for The New York TimesIsrael launched a major attack on Gaza, its first on that scale since the cease-fire with Hamas began roughly two months ago.Benjamin Netanyahu said he had ordered the attack because Hamas refused to release its remaining hostages. Israel consulted the White House before attacking.The strikes killed at least 300 people, including children, according to Gaza‚Äôs health ministry.The attack followed weeks of negotiations to extend the cease-fire. It was not clear whether Israel aimed to force Hamas to compromise or to start a new phase of war.The Israeli government says that 59 hostages are yet to be returned, and it believes that fewer than half of them remain alive.Government OverhaulIn Asheville, N.C.¬†Mike Belleme for The New York TimesTown halls in Republican districts have become tense. Voters are expressing anger and anxiety over Trump and Elon Musk‚Äôs government cuts.The Trump administration plans to eliminate the E.P.A.‚Äôs scientific research arm and fire as many as 1,155 chemists, biologists and other scientists.After a standoff involving the police, Musk‚Äôs DOGE team entered the headquarters of the U.S. Institute of Peace, an independent agency, and evicted its officials.The Department of Veterans Affairs halted most transgender medical treatments, citing a Trump executive order.Trump said he considered some of Biden‚Äôs pardons invalid because Biden had used an autopen, a common automatic signing device. There‚Äôs no power in the Constitution or case law to undo a pardon.The president also ended Secret Service protection for two of Biden‚Äôs children, Hunter and Ashley.More on the Trump AdministrationTrump privately told auto executives to prepare to operate under tariffs.Trump says he will release thousands of files this afternoon related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.The administration asked 20 prominent law firms for information about diversity, equity and inclusion practices in their recruitment, suggesting they could have discriminated against white candidates.Trump visited the Kennedy Center for the first time since taking over the organization. At a board meeting, he floated the idea that he might host its honors ceremony.Starlink, Musk‚Äôs satellite internet service, is now accessible across the White House complex.More on PoliticsA conservative F.D.A. lawyer defended the Biden administration‚Äôs position on the abortion pill. In retaliation, a Republican senator has forced her out of her role.Senator Chuck Schumer postponed his book tour because of backlash to his decision to vote with Republicans to prevent a government shutdown.War in UkraineIn his call with Vladimir Putin today, Trump will, in essence, negotiate how large a reward Russia will receive for its 11 years of aggression against Ukraine, David Sanger writes.Russia has sabotaged warehouses, railways and undersea cables, escalating its actions over the past two years to pressure the U.S. and Europe to curb support for Ukraine, a study found.In a town near Ukraine‚Äôs front line, a popular sushi restaurant braves artillery strikes to bring in its fish.Other Big StoriesThe daughter of Gis√®le and Dominique Pelicot uses the pen name Caroline Darian.¬†Andrea Mantovani for The New York TimesThe daughter of Gis√®le Pelicot believes her father drugged and raped her, too.Texas authorities arrested a midwife and an associate, and charged them with illegally performing abortions in greater Houston.Harvard will offer free tuition for students whose families earn less than $200,000. Other elite colleges have made similar changes in an effort to diversify their student bodies.A swath of the southern and central Plains faces severe fire danger, with dry air and wind gusts of up to 40 miles per hour.Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, the NASA astronauts who have been stuck at the International Space Station for months, are headed back to Earth.OpinionsChina cracked down on fentanyl before Trump took office. His tariffs might make Beijing cooperate less, not more, Brandon Yoder writes.Andrew Cuomo understands better than his rivals what New Yorkers want from their transit system: for it to be as safe as it used to be, Nicole Gelinas writes.Here‚Äôs a column by Michelle Goldberg on a Meta whistle-blower.A subscription to match the variety of your interests.News.

Plus, a ‚Äúretirement home‚Äù for penguins.View in browser|nytimes.comMarch 18, 2025By Emmett LindnerGood morning. We‚Äôre covering President Trump‚Äôs upcoming phone call with Vladimir Putin and a legal battle over migrant deportations in the U.S.Plus, a ‚Äúretirement home‚Äù for penguins.‚ÄúWe want to see if we can bring that war to an end,‚Äù President Trump said on Sunday. ¬†Tierney L. Cross for The New York TimesQuestions swirl as Putin and Trump prepare to speakPreparations are underway for a highly anticipated phone call today between President Trump and President Vladimir Putin. The call would be the first known conversation between the two leaders since Ukraine agreed to support a U.S.-backed monthlong cease-fire.On Sunday, Trump suggested that a cease-fire and the fate of Ukrainian power plants would be on the agenda, and he noted that ‚Äúdividing up certain assets‚Äù had been discussed. The Kremlin would not confirm any specific agenda.While Trump has stated his desire to broker some sort of truce between Russia and Ukraine as quickly as possible, Putin seems to be seeking to exploit the moment to win more concessions. Putin has not yet agreed to the cease-fire and has laid out conditions that could delay or derail a truce.Crimes against Ukraine: The U.S. is withdrawing from a multinational group created to investigate leaders responsible for the invasion of Ukraine, including Putin, a letter shows. It is the latest indication that the White House is moving away from a commitment to hold Putin accountable.Comfort food: Sushi has long been popular in Ukraine, and for people in the frontline town of Sloviansk, the treat provides a sense of normalcy.Judge James Boasberg is pressing the Trump administration over the deportation of migrants to El Salvador. ¬†Erin Schaff/The New York TimesA legal battle erupted over U.S. deportationsPresident Trump‚Äôs so-called border czar, Tom Homan, said yesterday that the administration planned to continue deportations of migrants despite a court order ‚Äî an action that could thrust the U.S. into a constitutional crisis.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not stopping,‚Äù Homan said in an interview. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what the judges think.‚ÄùThe judge who issued the order blocking deportations scheduled a hearing to press officials for details, and denied a last-minute request by the Trump administration that it be canceled. The Justice Department also wrote a letter to the court that sits over the judge, asking it to remove him from the case entirely. Here‚Äôs the latest.Background: Over the weekend, the U.S. flew more than 200 immigrants, including people the Trump administration has accused of being gang members, to El Salvador ‚Äî a move the judge had ordered to stop. The judge wants to know where the planes were at the time of his order, issued on Saturday.More on TrumpAmerican automakers thought Trump‚Äôs tariffs were a negotiating tactic. As it turns out, he sees them as an end in themselves.The growing trade war and rapid policy shifts are expected to drag down economic growth in the U.S. and around the world, according to projections.With the arrival of Dan Bongino as deputy director of the F.B.I., staunch Trump loyalists have now taken full command of the nation‚Äôs premier law enforcement agency.Do Americans approve of Trump? We‚Äôre tracking recent polls.Trump falsely claimed that former President Biden‚Äôs pardons were ‚Äúvoid‚Äù because he used an autopen, a commonly used device that reproduces signatures.Track Trump‚Äôs actions since he took office.M23 fighters in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in January.¬†Guerchom Ndebo for The New York TimesRwanda cut ties with Belgium over E.U. sanctionsThe E.U., at the urging of Belgium, yesterday imposed sanctions on Rwandan military and government officials for their role in the invasion of the Democratic Republic of Congo. In response, Rwanda severed diplomatic ties with Belgium, its former colonial ruler, and gave the country‚Äôs diplomats 48 hours to leave.The E.U. has accused Rwanda of funding the armed rebel group M23, which has fought government forces in Congo for more than a decade. The sanctions were Europe‚Äôs first step to increase pressure on Rwanda over the conflict. Also in response, M23 leaders said they would not take part in peace talks this week with Congolese officials.MORE TOP NEWSPool photo by Yair SagiIsrael: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs attempt to fire the head of Shin Bet, the country‚Äôs domestic spy agency, reflects his wider push for greater control.South Sudan: After less than a decade of fragile peace, the country is once again on the brink of war. Here‚Äôs what you need to know.South Korea: Relatives of the 179 people who died in the Jeju Air plane crash in December are pressing for answers.Social media: Pavel Durov, the Telegram founder who was charged in France last year with a range of crimes, was allowed to temporarily leave the country.Education: Harvard announced that it planned to offer free tuition for students whose families earn $200,000 and below to boost diversity.North Macedonia: Prosecutors are seeking to arrest a former economy minister in connection with a fire at a nightclub that killed at least 59 people.Syria: Sectarian-driven civilian killings have displayed the government‚Äôs weak control over its own forces and affiliated fighters.U.S.: Forever 21, which helped popularize fast fashion, filed for bankruptcy.Tech: As companies chase the dream of artificial intelligence, data centers are popping up around the globe.

Ideally, to your own island. Six geriatric African penguins at a Boston aquarium are enjoying their golden years on an island designed to address the pains of aging. They are kept separate from younger, boisterous penguins, are given plenty of fish and even have access to physical therapy.The aquarium‚Äôs curator described the island as a ‚Äúcountry club for older animals.‚ÄùLives lived: Lee Shau-kee, a Hong Kong real estate tycoon who made billions initially building apartments for descendants of refugees from mainland China, died at 97.CONVERSATION STARTERSShort cut or wrong turn?: TikTok users claim that standing on a vibrating platform will have you shedding kilos in no time.
